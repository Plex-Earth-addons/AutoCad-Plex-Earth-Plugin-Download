## 🧠 Overview

**Plex-Earth** is a specialized extension that expands AutoCAD functionality with advanced geospatial capabilities. It enables designers and engineers to incorporate satellite imagery, digital terrain models, and online map data directly into their drafting environment.

By integrating geographic information into CAD drawings, Plex-Earth allows professionals to design with accurate real-world context. Users can import high-resolution imagery, generate terrain surfaces, and align projects using precise coordinate systems — all within a unified workspace.

The tool is particularly valuable for civil engineering, land development, surveying, and infrastructure planning projects where topography and geographic positioning play a critical role. With efficient data handling and intuitive controls, it simplifies complex site analysis and terrain modeling tasks.

Plex-Earth transforms AutoCAD into a powerful geospatial design platform, bridging the gap between mapping data and technical drafting.
